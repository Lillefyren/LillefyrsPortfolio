        My name is Casper Ingemann St√¶hr. <br />
         <br />
        I am a multimediadesigner in education. <br />
         <br />
        I also make videogames in my free time and have worked on a proffesional game project for the past year.  <br />
         <br />
        I was born with a bone-disease called Multiple Hereditary Exostoses, which is part of my obsession with skeletons. <br />
         <br />
        In my sparetime I enjoy playing card games and kicking ass in fighting games.  <br />
         <br />
        If you need someone with a diverse toolset, or simply someone with a little bit of game development experience, head over to my Contact page and grab me on one of my many platforms. <br />
